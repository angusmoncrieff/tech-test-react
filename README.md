# Tech test - SABSTT - React

I've done a rather basic 'set list' demo app (i.e. for a wedding band, say).

In fact, I've used many more aspects of React before, but I'm afraid I don't have time today or in the next week to work on this more.

FWIW, I have also used:

* Other hooks: useEffect, useContext, useRef + one or two custom hooks (e.g. a useWidthDetector hook)
* Redux with React
* react-router
* testing with Jest and react-testing-library
* libraries such as react-helmet, react-html-parser, react-joyride, react-scroll, react-transition-group, reactstrap, ...

I've used these in my [scales](https://www.scale-lookup.com) project. I've kept the repo private for now, but I would be happy to grant access to an individual to have a look at my work.
